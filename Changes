Revision history for Perl extension Apache::Pod

0.10    May 10, 2004
        [FEATURES]
        * Pod links link to the filename.  Thereform, L<foo.pod> links
        to foo.pod, instead of "TODO".  This is only until Sean does
        his magic in Pod::Simple::HTML so this fudgery isn't needed.

        [FIXES]
        * Handlers now properly return OK.

        [INTERNALS]
        * Now overriding Pod::Simple::HTML.
        * Added pod.t and pod-coverage.t
        * Changed the handling of the CSS as a __DATA__ section.

0.03    September 9, 2003
        * Added stylesheet handling, including replicating the
          search.cpan.org stylesheet as a default.  Thanks very much to
          Grant McLean for the patch.

0.02    September 29, 2002
        * Seems to find modules correctly, a la perldoc.

0.01    September 26, 2002
        * First version
